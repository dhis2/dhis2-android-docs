| **Schedule after completion** |Redesigned schedule dialog for better event creation. ![](resources/versionupdateimages/image17.png) | "Schedule After Completion" feature was not introduced or changed for aggregate data sets.In earlier versions, and continuing in 3.2, “Schedule After Completion” can be configured in the web-based program settings.|
| **Maps** | From 3.1, the capture coordinates process now includes a feature that displays the precision of the captured location. This allows users to see how accurate their location data is in real-time [Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture_app_programs_common_features_map_accuracy)![](resources/versionupdateimages/image3.1.1.png).By dragging the map the user can choose the pin location manually. At the bottom of the map, the label "selected location" will be displayed with the respective coordinates.In 3.1 the manual capture can be disabled (Android settings webApp configuration).This will hid the search bar and won't allow the user to select any location on the map. It will be restricted to save the current location only.| To enhance the process of capturing coordinates and align to the behavior in tracker programs, a search bar has been implemented. This feature allows users to input textual information, such as street names or numbers, to facilitate the identification of specific locations.![](resources/versionupdateimages/v3.2.5.png) |
| **Customized Tracker Terminology** | **In 3.1, the term "event" (program context) is now customizable.** To customize the terms, the admin can go to the Maintenance and when creating or editing the program add a text to: 1.

# Document Map { #implementation_guide_document_map }

The Android implementation process can be broken into distinct phases to guide planning and decision-making from early setup through long-term support. This document map outlines those phases and connects each to the relevant sections of this guide. While many projects will follow this structure, it can be adapted based on your local timeline, team capacity, and implementation scope.
